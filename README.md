# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project provides a Python script to perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on sparse matrices stored in text files.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Text files containing the sparse matrices in the specified format.

## Matrix Format

Each matrix should be stored in a text file where each line represents a non-zero value in the matrix. The format for each line is:
## Usage

1. Place your matrix text files in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script `sparse_matrix_operations.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to select the matrix files and the desired operation.

## Output

The result of the chosen operation will be saved automatically in the file `output/output.txt`. If the directory `output` does not exist, it will be created automatically.

## Example

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python3 sparse_matrix_operations.py
    ```
2. Follow the prompts to select the matrix files and the desired operation.
3. The result will be saved in `output/output.txt`.
